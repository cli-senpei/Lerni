🧠 Lerni
A Duolingo-style learning platform built for dyslexic learners

Lerni is a fun, adaptive learning platform that combines mini-games, AI, and the Orton–Gillingham approach to help people with dyslexia strengthen reading and language skills. It turns science-backed reading instruction into playful, intelligent, and personalized experiences.

🚀 Overview

Unlike traditional learning apps, Lerni evolves with every player.
It tracks each learner’s mistakes, reaction time, and confusion patterns (like b/d reversals or “tion/sion” mix-ups), then uses AI and predictive logic to automatically select:

The right difficulty level 🧩

The most effective game type 🎮

As users improve, games become more challenging and dynamic.
When they struggle, Lerni slows down, adjusts feedback, and provides targeted practice. Over time, the platform learns each user’s unique challenges and builds a personalized learning path — like having a digital reading specialist inside every game.
