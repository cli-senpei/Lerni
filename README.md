🧠 Lerni
A Duolingo-style learning platform built for dyslexic learners

Lerni is a fun, adaptive learning platform that combines mini-games, AI, and the Orton–Gillingham approach to help people with dyslexia strengthen reading and language skills. It turns science-backed reading instruction into playful, intelligent, and personalized experiences.

🚀 Overview

Unlike traditional learning apps, Lerni evolves with every player.
It tracks each learner’s mistakes, reaction time, and confusion patterns (like b/d reversals or “tion/sion” mix-ups), then uses AI and predictive logic to automatically select:

The next best activity 🎯

The right difficulty level 🧩

The most effective game type 🎮

As users improve, games become more challenging and dynamic.
When they struggle, Lerni slows down, adjusts feedback, and provides targeted practice. Over time, the platform learns each user’s unique challenges and builds a personalized learning path — like having a digital reading specialist inside every game.

---OUTSTANDING ISSUES---
1- The 'I already have an account' button redirects to the login page, but the button that populates is 'get started' button, which requires you to click the link below.
2. Need API to help with AI bot, with more rich context and responses.
3. When Logged in, the header icon, redirects to home, instead of dashboard.
4. Need to improve the dynamic game generation to have more rich games, currently generated games are very simple.
